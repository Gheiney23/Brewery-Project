# Brewery-Project
I found raw csv file data on Kagle based on breweries accross the United States
I used the data to find what breweries were in North Dakota and what the most populary beer was in the state
The data only presented one brewery in the state with the id 335
Based on the data the most populary beer was American IPA
The csv files I uesed are attatched as beers.csv and breweries.csv
